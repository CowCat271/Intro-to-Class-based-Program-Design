[Assignment 5: A Game](https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs2510sp22/assignment5.html)

>You are going to design a game called N Bullets, based on the game [10 Bullets](https://www.crazygames.com/game/10-bullets-html-5).
>N Bullets is a game in which ships fly across the screen and the player shoots bullets at them from the center of the bottom of the screen. When a bullet and ship collide, both are instantly destroyed. The bullet, however, is replaced by a group of bullets that fly out to hit other ships. The game ends when the player run out of bullets and no more bullets are on screen.
